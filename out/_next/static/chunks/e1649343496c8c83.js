When storing or handling hazardous materials exceeding this quantity, fire service law regulations apply.",difficulty:"basic"},{id:11,category:"Physics & Chemistry",question:"Which is not included in the three elements of combustion?",choices:["Combustible material","Oxygen supply source","Ignition source","Moisture"],correctAnswer:3,explanation:"The three elements of combustion are combustible material, oxygen supply source (oxidizer), and ignition source (heat source). Moisture is not included in the three elements of combustion.",difficulty:"exam"},{id:12,category:"Physics & Chemistry",question:"What is the correct explanation of flash point?",choices:["Temperature at which liquid naturally starts burning","Minimum temperature at which liquid emits vapor that ignites when a flame is applied","Temperature at which liquid boils","Temperature at which liquid solidifies"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"Flash point is the minimum temperature at which a combustible liquid emits vapor that ignites when a flame is applied.",difficulty:"exam"},{id:13,category:"Hazmat Properties",question:"What is the correct property of diesel fuel?",choices:["Flash point is below 40°C","Flash point is 45°C or above","Gas at room temperature","Heavier than water"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"Diesel fuel has a flash point of 45°C or above, which is even higher than kerosene, making it a relatively safe hazardous material.",difficulty:"exam"},{id:14,category:"Hazmat Properties",question:"What is correct about the specific gravity of Class 4 hazardous materials?",choices:["All are heavier than water","All are lighter than water","Most are lighter than water","Specific gravity is irrelevant"],correctAnswer:2,explanation:"Most Class 4 hazardous materials (flammable liquids) are lighter than water and float on water. Therefore, water-based extinguishing is ineffective and fire may spread.",difficulty:"exam"},{id:15,category:"Physics & Chemistry",question:"What is the correct explanation of ignition point?",choices:["Temperature at which liquid starts to evaporate","Temperature at which it spontaneously ignites without an ignition source when heated in air","Temperature at which liquid cools down","Same temperature as flash point"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"Ignition point is the minimum temperature at which combustible material spontaneously ignites without an ignition source when heated in air. It is higher than the flash point.",difficulty:"exam"},{id:16,category:"Fire Extinguishing",question:"What is the correct principle of smothering fire extinguishing?",choices:["Cool the burning material","Cut off oxygen supply","Remove combustible material","Promote combustion"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"Smothering fire extinguishing is a method of extinguishing by cutting off the oxygen supply needed for combustion. Foam extinguishers and carbon dioxide extinguishers fall into this category.",difficulty:"exam"},{id:17,category:"Storage & Handling",question:"Which method is incorrect for preventing static electricity disasters?",choices:["Ensure proper grounding","Maintain appropriate humidity","Speed up work","Use conductive footwear"],correctAnswer:2,explanation:"Speeding up work is incorrect as a static electricity countermeasure. Conversely, working slowly can suppress static electricity generation.",difficulty:"exam"},{id:18,category:"Regulations",question:"What is the correct frequency of periodic inspections for hazardous materials facilities?",choices:["Daily","Once a year or more","Once every 3 years or more","No inspection obligation"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"Owners of hazardous materials facilities are obligated to conduct periodic inspections once a year or more and keep records.",difficulty:"exam"},{id:19,category:"Physics & Chemistry",question:"What is the correct property of gases with vapor density greater than 1?",choices:["Lighter than air and rises","Heavier than air and accumulates in low areas","Same weight as air","Liquid"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"Gases with vapor density greater than 1 are heavier than air and accumulate in low areas. When ventilating, it is important to exhaust from the bottom.",difficulty:"exam"},{id:20,category:"Hazmat Properties",question:"What is the correct characteristic of alcohols?",choices:["Insoluble in water","Soluble in water","Solid at room temperature","Non-flammable"],correctAnswer:1,explanation:"Alcohols have the property of being soluble in water. Therefore, alcohol-resistant foam extinguishers must be used for alcohol fires.",difficulty:"exam"}])},84131,e=>{"use strict";let t="hazmat-quiz-progress";e.s(["clearAllProgress",0,()=>{try{localStorage.removeItem(t)}catch(e){console.error("Error clearing localStorage:",e)}},"getAllProgress",0,()=>{try{let e=localStorage.getItem(t);return e?JSON.parse(e):{}}catch(e){return console.error("Error reading from localStorage:",e),{}}},"saveQuestionProgress",0,(e,a)=>{try{let i=localStorage.getItem(t),r=i?JSON.parse(i):{},s=r[e];s?r[e]={questionId:e,correctCount:s.correctCount+ +!!a,incorrectCount:s.incorrectCount+ +!a,lastAttemptCorrect:a}:r[e]={questionId:e,correctCount:+!!a,incorrectCount:+!a,lastAttemptCorrect:a},localStorage.setItem(t,JSON.stringify(r))}catch(e){console.error("Error writing to localStorage:",e)}},"shouldShowQuestion",0,e=>{let a=(e=>{try{let a=localStorage.getItem(t);if(!a)return null;return JSON.parse(a)[e]||null}catch(e){return console.error("Error reading from localStorage:",e),null}})(e);return!a||a.correctCount<4}])},18566,(e,t,a)=>{t.exports=e.r(76562)},93232,e=>{"use strict";var t=e.i(43476),a=e.i(71645),i=e.i(18566),r=e.i(71640),s=e.i(84131);let o=r.default;function n(){let e=(0,i.useSearchParams)(),r=(0,i.useRouter)(),n=e.get("category")||"all",l=e.get("difficulty")||"all",[c,h]=(0,a.useState)([]),[u,d]=(0,a.useState)(0),[m,g]=(0,a.useState)(null),[p,f]=(0,a.useState)(!1),[y,b]=(0,a.useState)(20),[x,w]=(0,a.useState)(!1);(0,a.useEffect)(()=>{let e=o.filter(e=>{let t="all"===n||e.category===n,a="all"===l||e.difficulty===l,i=(0,s.shouldShowQuestion)(e.id);return t&&a&&i});0===e.length?r.push("/stats"):h(e)},[n,l,r]),(0,a.useEffect)(()=>{if(p||0===c.length)return;if(0===y){w(!0),v();return}let e=setInterval(()=>{b(e=>e-1)},1e3);return()=>clearInterval(e)},[y,p,c.length]);let v=()=>{let e=c[u];e&&((0,s.saveQuestionProgress)(e.id,!1),f(!0))};if(0===c.length)return(0,t.jsx)("div",{className:"text-center",children:(0,t.jsx)("div",{className:"spinner-border text-primary",role:"status",children:(0,t.jsx)("span",{className:"visually-hidden",children:"Loading..."})})});let C=c[u],q=m===C.correctAnswer,S="exam"===C.difficulty?"bg-danger":"bg-success",z="exam"===C.difficulty?"Exam":"Basic";return(0,t.jsx)("main",{children:(0,t.jsx)("div",{className:"row",children:(0,t.jsxs)("div",{className:"col-12",children:[(0,t.jsxs)("div",{className:"d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center mb-3",children:[(0,t.jsxs)("h2",{className:"h5 mb-0",children:["Question ",u+1," / ",c.length]}),(0,t.jsxs)("div",{children:[(0,t.jsx)("span",{className:`badge ${S} me-2`,children:z}),(0,t.jsx)("span",{className:"badge bg-secondary me-2",children:C.category}),!p&&(0,t.jsxs)("span",{className:`badge ${y<=5?"bg-danger":"bg-primary"} fs-6`,children:[y,"s left"]})]})]}),(0,t.jsx)("div",{className:"card",children:(0,t.jsxs)("div",{className:"card-body",children:[(0,t.jsx)("h3",{className:"card-title h5 mb-4",children:C.question}),(0,t.jsx)("div",{className:"d-grid gap-2",children:C.choices.map((e,a)=>{let i="btn btn-outline-primary text-start";return p?i=a===C.correctAnswer?"btn btn-success text-start":a===m?"btn btn-danger text-start":"btn btn-outline-secondary text-start":m===a&&(i="btn btn-primary text-start"),(0,t.jsxs)("button",{className:i,onClick:()=>(e=>{if(p||x)return;g(e);let t=c[u],a=e===t.correctAnswer;(0,s.saveQuestionProgress)(t.id,a),f(!0)})(a),disabled:p,children:[a+1,".
